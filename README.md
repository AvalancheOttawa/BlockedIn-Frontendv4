# Automated Tetris: Enhancing Focus and Accountability Through AI

Welcome to Automated Tetris, a unique spin on the classic game that combines cutting-edge AI with interactive gameplay. This project explores semi-automation to engage users, promote accountability, and enhance focus using innovative AI-powered techniques.
üöÄ Project Overview

## Automated Tetris introduces a semi-automated model to gameplay:

    The AI provides two placement options for each falling piece:
        Optimal Placement: The best possible move.
        Suboptimal Placement: A poor move designed to challenge the player.
    The player‚Äôs role is to select the correct placement, ensuring accountability for their decisions.

In the background, the AI leverages multiple datasets to measure the player‚Äôs focus and engagement:

    Eye Tracking (via OpenCV): Tracks where the player is looking during gameplay.
    Emotional Analysis: Determines the player's emotional state.
    Game Performance Metrics: Measures reaction times, decision accuracy, and gameplay consistency.

When the AI detects low focus, the game activates Focus Mode, temporarily removing hints to encourage players to rely solely on their instincts and improve their focus.
## ‚ú® Features

    AI-Powered Gameplay Assistance
        Provides two placement hints for each Tetris piece: one optimal and one suboptimal.
        Encourages critical thinking and decision-making.

    Focus Mode
        Activated when the AI detects a lack of focus.
        Temporarily removes hints to challenge the player and enhance engagement.

    Real-Time Focus Analysis
        Powered by Groq, an advanced AI system that integrates:
            Eye Tracking: Ensures players are visually engaged with the board.
            Emotional Analysis: Detects focus-related emotions such as frustration or boredom.
            Gameplay Metrics: Monitors reaction times and accuracy.

    Interactive and Accountable Gameplay
        Semi-automation ensures players remain actively involved in decision-making.
        Accountability is central to gameplay, encouraging mindfulness.

    Cross-Platform Compatibility
        Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless web-based play.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

    HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Core web technologies for building the game interface and logic.
    Python: Backend processing for AI-powered focus analysis.
    Groq AI: Advanced AI system for analyzing datasets and enhancing gameplay decisions.
    OpenCV: Used for real-time eye tracking to ensure player focus.
    WebSockets: Enables real-time communication between the front-end and back-end.
    Git: Version control for collaborative development.

## üéÆ How to Play

    Start the game and begin placing Tetris pieces.
    For each piece, the AI will offer two placement options:
        One optimal placement.
        One suboptimal placement.
    Select the best option and continue playing.
    Stay focused! The AI continuously monitors your:
        Eye movements.
        Emotional state.
        Gameplay performance.
    If your focus dips, the game enters Focus Mode, removing all hints temporarily.

## üìà AI Focus Metrics

The Groq AI system analyzes multiple datasets to monitor player focus, including:

    Eye Tracking (OpenCV): Detects where the player is looking during gameplay.
    Emotional Analysis: Assesses player emotions, such as frustration or engagement.
    Performance Metrics: Tracks reaction speed and placement accuracy.

## üåü Why This Project Matters

Automated Tetris demonstrates how AI and human decision-making can coexist, blending automation with accountability. By promoting focus and mindfulness through gameplay, this project highlights how AI can be used to create engaging and cognitively enriching experiences.
